# django chatting app

This is a simple room based chatting app that I created using django and little bit javascript.
Firstly, the user is asked to enter the room name and username. If room already exists then user is taken to that room.
If the room does not exist then a new room is created.

### Here is the window to enter the room:

### Multiple users can chat in the same room.
